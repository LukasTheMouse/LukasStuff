## Project Description
Write a short description of your project. Write 1-2 sentences about the game you chose to build and why.
I played battleships with my brothers in the past. I think this was a game that I could scale really easilly in terms of complexity

## Rules
Player determines the quadrant between 8 and 10. 
Sets coordinates for the ships
Starts guessing (shooting) the locations where the locations of the CPU are.

## Workflow
Outline the workflow you used in your project. What are the steps you went through?

- Determine how much time I could spend on the project
- Determine the requirements of a MVP

## Organization
How did you organize your work? Did you use any tools like a kanban board?

I broke down the work in functions so I could gradually build up the codes and features.

What does your repository look like? Explain your folder and file structure.
Plain vanilla everything is stored in the same folder because of the simplicity of the game

## Links
Include links to your repository, slides and kanban board. Feel free to include any other links associated with your project.
